# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Pewlett Hackard has a substantial portion of its workforce approaching retirment age. The company assigned this project to query their employee databases for information regarding the number of personnel reaching retirement age, departments, titles, and salaries. The company needs to be prepared to replace the folks who plan to retire in the forseeable future and also suggested creating a mentorship program to take advantage of senior staff expertise for training younger employees. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 

Pewlett Hackard will face a "silver tsunami", ie a large portion of its workforce will begin to enter retirment in the next several years. Of those employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, 67,366 will be eligible for retirement.
 
<br>The first part of this "silver tsunami" will be those born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1952 (displayed in table below). The total number of the first wave of retiring employees is 21,209 which breaks down into the following job titles: Engineers (7,432), Senior Staff (6,635), Staff (2,481), Senior Engineer (2,169), Assistant Engineer (1,069), Technique Leaders (1,062), and 1 Manager. There are a large number of roles which need to be filled by Hewlett Packard as forseen by the first wave of retirees followed by the rest of the eligible workforce.

<br>Luckily, becuase Hewlett Packard is planning ahead, they have already be contemplating setting up a mentorship program for eligible employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. This mentorhsip program should ease the transition into a new chapter for the company as younger members are trained by more senior employees. According to the queries run and displayed in the table below, there are 1,549 employees eligible for the program which breaks down into the following job titles: Senior Staff (422), Engineer (385), Senior Engineer (306), Staff (302), Technique Leaders (77), Assistant Engineer (57).

Thus, even those employees born in 1952 leaving the company very soon, it is evident that there are still enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The mentorship program is an excellent idea to provide the company with internal support, continue investing in its current workforce, and look forward to future endeavors.
