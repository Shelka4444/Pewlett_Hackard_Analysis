# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Pewlett Hackard has a substantial portion of its workforce approaching retirment. The company assigned this project to query their employee databases for information regarding the number of personnel reaching retirment age, departments, titles, and salaries. The company needed to be prepared to replace the folks who planned to retire in the forseeable future and suggested creating a mentorship program to take advantage of senior staff expertise when training younger employees. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
